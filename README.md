# monolith_event_driven

### This project is a minimalist Ruby on Rails application designed to explore event-driven architecture within a monolithic framework using PostgreSQL. It includes basic models to represent various domains and simulates event processing

- [x] Basic models for Order, Product, Inventory, Shipping, Notifications, and Reporting
- [x] Event simulation using ActiveJob for processing events
- [x] Seed data to demonstrate interactions between domains

**Purpose**: This project serves as an experimental platform for understanding event-driven principles in a monolithic structure. It provides practical insights into how components can communicate through events while maintaining simplicity in design.
